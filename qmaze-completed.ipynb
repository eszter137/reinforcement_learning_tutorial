    "## Background\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique for solving problems by a\n",
    "feedback system (rewards and penalties)\n",
    "applied on an **agent** which operates in an **environment** and needs to move through\n",
    "a series of states in order to reach a pre-defined final state.\n",
    "A classical example is a rat (agent) which is trying to find the shortest route from\n",
    "a starting cell to a target cheese cell in a maze (environment).\n",
    "The agent is **experimenting** and **exploiting** past experiences (**episodes**) in\n",
    "order to achieve its goal.\n",
    "It may fail again and again, but hopefully, after lots of trial and error\n",
    "(and seeing the resulting rewards and penalties) it will arrive to the solution of the problem.\n",
    "The solution will be reached if the agent finds the optimal sequence of states\n",
    "in which the **accumulated sum of rewards** is maximal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it may happen that in order to reach the goal,\n",
    "the agent will have to endure many penalties (negative rewards) on its way.\n",
    "For example, the rat in the above maze will get a small penalty for every legal move.\n",
    "The reason for that is that we want it to get to the target cell in the shortest possible path.\n",
    "However, the shortest path to the target cheese cell is sometimes long and winding,\n",
    "and our agent (the rat) may have to endure many penalties until it gets to the \"cheese\"\n",
    "(sometimes called \"delayed reward\")."

    "The story of **epsilon**, also called **exploration factor**\n",
    "is part of the larger **Q-learning** story:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The main objective of Q-training is to develope a **policy** $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$\n",
    "for navigating the maze successfully.\n",
    "Presumably, after playing hundreds of games, the **agent** (rat in our case)\n",
    "should attain a clear deterministic policy for how to act in every possible situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The term **policy** should be understood simply as a function $\\pi$ that takes\n",
    "a maze snapshot (**envstate**) as input and returns the action to be taken by the **agent** (rat in our case).\n",
    "The input consists of the full nxn maze state and the rat location.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textbf{next action} = \\boldsymbol{\\pi}(\\textbf{state})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. At start, we simply choose a completely random policy.\n",
    "Then we use it to play thousands of games from which we learn how to perfect it.\n",
    "Surely, at the early training stages, our policy $\\pi$ will yield lots of errors\n",
    "and cause us to lose many games,\n",
    "but our rewarding policy should provide feedback for it on how to improve itself.\n",
    "Here, our learning engine is going to be a simple feed-forward neural network which takes\n",
    "an environment state (maze cells) as input and yields a reward per action vector\n",
    "(see later for better description).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In order to enhance the Q-learning process, we shall use two types of moves:\n",
    "    * **Exploitation**: these are moves that our policy $\\pi$ dictates based on previous experiences.\n",
    "      The policy function will be used in about 90% of the moves before it is completed.\n",
    "    * **Exploration**: in about 10% of the cases, we take a completely random action in order to acquire new experiences (and possibly meet bigger rewards) which our strategy function may not allow us to make due to its restrictive nature.\n",
    "      Think of it as choosing a completely random new restaurant once in a while instead of choosing the routine restaurants that you are already familiar with. The exploration factor **epsilon** is the frequency level of how much **exploration** to do. It is usually set to 0.1, there are however many other usage schemes you can try (you can even tune epsilon during training!)"

    "1. A more challenging maze problem is a cat/mouse chase puzzle in which the blocked\n",
    "   cells, as well as the mouse are moving in time.\n",
    "   This is the type of problems in which classical algorithms are starting to get rough\n",
    "   and deep learning techniques could provide better answers.\n",
    "2. There are plenty of variations on the above type of games.\n",
    "   We can for example add a cheese to the maze and then we have a double-chase scene:\n",
    "   the cat chases the mouse, and the mouse chases the moving cheese.\n",
    "   This is also known as\n",
    "   [the Theseus and Minotaur Maze](http://lafarren.com/theseus-minotaur-solver),\n",
    "   and it belongs to the multi-agent type of problems.\n",
    "   Current Reinforcement Learning techniques are still in their infancy and there's \n",
    "   a vast room for further reseach and development.\n",
    "3. We can throw several pieces of cheese to the maze and the rat will have to find the shortest\n",
    "   route for collecting all of them.\n",
    "   Of course, we can also add complications like moving cells and moving cheese, but it seems like\n",
    "   the static version is hard enough.\n",
    "4. There are also 3-dimensional versions of these maze problems, which are hard to visualize,\n",
    "   and probably much harder to solve, but sooner or later they must be used for testing,\n",
    "   validating, and enhancing deep reinforcement learning techniques.\n",
    "5. In our next notebook we will explore the \"Tour De Flags\" maze in which an agent has to collect\n",
    "   a group of flags and deliver them to a target cell. The agent must find a shortest route\n",
    "   for doing so. The agent receives bonus points for collecting each flag, and receives the full\n",
